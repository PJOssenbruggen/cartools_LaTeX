  abstract={A traffic jam on a highway is a very familiar phenomenon. From the physical viewpoint, the system of vehicular flow is a non-equilibrium system of interacting particles (vehicles). The collective effect of the many-particle system induces the instability of a free flow state caused by the enhancement of fluctuations, and the transition to a jamming state occurs spontaneously if the average vehicle density exceeds a certain critical value. Thus, a bottleneck is only a trigger and not the essential origin of a traffic jam. In this paper, we present the first experimental evidence that the emergence of a traffic jam is a collective phenomenon like 'dynamical' phase transitions and pattern formation in a non-equilibrium system. We have performed an experiment on a circuit to show the emergence of a jam with no bottleneck. In the initial condition, all the vehicles are moving, homogeneously distributed on the circular road, with the same velocity. The average density of the vehicles is prepared for the onset of the instability. Even a tiny fluctuation grows larger and then the homogeneous movement cannot be maintained. Finally, a jam cluster appears and propagates backward like a solitary wave with the same speed as that of a jam cluster on a highway.}

abstract = "A model of the evolution of speed perturbations in dense traffic flow is presented in this work. Traffic volume is assumed to be at capacity and a given vehicle undergoes a temporary speed drop. This speed drop may propagate through the traffic flow until it is either dissipated or causes the stoppage of the traffic flow. The two events are random and occur with a certain probability. The proposed model leads to a set of recurrence equations for the speed drop and its duration. The simulation of those equations allows the estimation of the normalization probability, that is, the probability that the perturbation vanishes. An analytical approximation for the normalization probability is also proposed. The approximation is based on a result from Brownian motion theory. The agreement with the simulation results is fairly good given the simplicity of the approximation. The model and its analytical approximation allows one to conjecture which could be the most important parameters that determine the evolution of the perturbation. The implications of this conjecture are commented and the assumptions of the model are contrasted with related work."

abstract = "This paper proposes a novel approach to managing capacity planning flexibility in engineering systems based on decision rules and differential evolution (DE) algorithm. A multi-stage capacity expansion problem is formalized based on a decision rule representation. The formalized model can analyze multiple sources of uncertainty simultaneously (e.g., changes in demand and material price) and explicitly consider design principles like economies of scale and learning effect. An evolutionary decision rule optimization framework based on the DE algorithm is proposed to automatically optimize the decision rule for capacity planning. Compared to traditional capacity planning models (e.g., stochastic programming), this work is able to offer a flexible capacity plan under uncertainty assumptions at the system design stage. The output of our approach is a decision rule that provides thresholds/conditions for decision-makers to adaptively adjust decisions at the system deployment stage. In the application of capacity planning for a waste-to-energy system, experimental results show that the decision rules generated by our approach offer a 20 percent improvement in terms of expected net present value, compared to a fixed capacity plan generated by stochastic programming."

In this paper, we introduce the driverâs three perceived errors into the car-following model, and construct a car-following model with the probability distributions of the three perceived errors to explore the effects of the three perceived errors on the driving behavior under three typical situations (i.e., uniform flow, shock and rarefaction waves, and a small perturbation). The numerical results show that the three perceived errors have significant impacts on the evolution of traffic flow (including the headway distribution), i.e., the distribution of density does not prominently change under the three traffic states. In addition, the impacts are directly related to the initial condition. The results can help drivers reasonably adjust their driving behaviors based on their current traffic state (especially when some stochastic factors exist)."

The assumption of stationarity allows us to linearize the model equations, but at the same time leads us to adding an appropriate stochastic term to the equation obtained from linearizing the original equations. The result is an infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equation describing the evolution of R(t,x). R(t,x) is the deviation of the density around some fixed value at time t and location x. R(t,x) is a stationary Gaussian process, if the initial value is suitably chosen. The process R(t,x) is determined by three parameters. Knowledge of these parameters may enable the traffic engineer to characterize the traffic stream as homogeneous or inhomogeneous. The model is tested with data measured on a Dutch freeway."

The system consists of induction loops embedded in the road surface and matrix signal boards mounted on gantries. The matrix boards may be used to display speed signals to the drivers. In this paper we investigate the control problem of choosing suitable speed values, with the aim of reducing the probability of congestion. A model for freeway traffic is presented that performs realistically in several basic traffic situations. An estimation algorithm or filter is derived that estimates the state of traffic at any time moment, using the measurements available from the signalling system. The filter is tested against simulated and against real traffic data and shown to behave satisfactorily. Finally, a control policy is designed for the speed signals. The design criterion is the expected total throughput of the freeway until congestion occurs. The optimal policy turns out to consist of switching on or off the control as the traffic density crosses specific switching levels."

The general master equation is applied to relatively simple models to describe the formation and dissolution of traffic congestions. Our approach is mainly based on spatially homogeneous systems like periodically closed circular rings without on- and off-ramps. We consider a stochastic one-step process of growth or shrinkage of a car cluster (jam). As generalization we discuss the coexistence of several car clusters of different sizes. The basic problem is to find a physically motivated ansatz for the transition rates of the attachment and detachment of individual cars to a car cluster consistent with the empirical observations in real traffic. The emphasis is put on the analogy with first-order phase transitions and nucleation phenomena in physical systems like supersaturated vapour. The results are summarized in the fluxâdensity relation, the so-called fundamental diagram of traffic flow, and compared with empirical data. Different regimes of traffic flow are discussed: free flow, congested mode as stop-and-go regime, and heavy viscous traffic. The traffic breakdown is studied based on the master equation as well as the FokkerâPlanck approximation to calculate mean first passage times or escape rates. Generalizations are developed to allow for on-ramp effects. The calculated fluxâdensity relation and characteristic breakdown times coincide with empirical data measured on highways. Finally, a brief summary of the stochastic cellular automata approach is given."

It is well-known that the interaction generally decreases the traffic efficiency and that randomness in the car flow can help cross-junction traffic efficiency. We show that proper long-range correlations in the flow noise, related to 1/f-like noises, provide superior traffic properties as compared to Poissonian or periodic car traffic. Moreover, a stochastic resonance phenomenon sensitive to the shape of the spectrum occurs. By a small modification, the model can be made relevant for neuronal spike traffic. Spike trains generated by Gaussian 1/f noise show superior spike traffic properties and efficiency of information transfer."

abstract = "In dynamic vehicle routing, it is common to respond to real-time information with immediate updates to routes and fleet management. However, even if routes are updated continuously, in practice, some decisions once made are difficult to reverse. At times, it may thus be valuable to wait for additional information before acting on a decision. We use the theory of optimal stopping to determine the optimal timing of a recourse action when vehicles are likely to miss customer deadlines due to travel-time stochasticities and backup services are available. The factors involved in making this decision â that is, the likelihood that the primary vehicle will arrive late, the location of the backup vehicle, and value of waiting for additional travel-time information â each change dynamically over time. We develop a recourse model that accounts for this complexity. We formulate the optimal recourse policy as a stochastic dynamic program. Properties of the optimal policy are derived analytically, and its solution is approximated with a binomial lattice method used in the pricing of American options. Finally, we develop a two-stage stochastic optimization approach to show how the opportunity to take recourse dynamically might be integrated into a priori scheduling and routing. The framework is demonstrated for a stochastic dial-a-ride application in which taxis serve as backup to ridesharing vehicles."

abstract = "Many car-following models predict a stable car-following behavior with a very small fluctuation around an equilibrium value gâ of the net headway g with zero speed-difference Îv between the following and the lead vehicle. However, it is well-known and additionally demonstrated by data in this paper, that the fluctuations are much larger than these models predict. Typically, the fluctuation in speed difference is around Â±2m/s, while the fluctuation in the net time headway T=g/v can be as big as one or even two seconds, which is as large as the mean time headway itself. By analyzing data from loop detectors as well as data from vehicle trajectories, evidence is provided that this randomness is not due to driver heterogeneity, but can be attributed to an internal stochasticity of the driver itself. A final model-based analysis supports the hypothesis, that the preferred headway of the driver is the parameter that is not kept constant but fluctuates strongly, thus causing the even macroscopically observable randomness in traffic flow."

abstract = "Car-following models are an essential part of microscopic traffic simulations. For research regarding traffic safety, traffic simulations need to simulate traffic safety related aspects realistically. That means, for example, accidents and near accidents shall occur in the same quantity and in the same way as in reality. Such simulations can be used to make statements about traffic safety with respect to traffic influencing factors and conditions. However, most car-following models are deterministic and do not incorporate uncertainty and fluctuations of perception and behavior. Also, they are explicitly conflict free. Therefore, they are unsuitable for simulating traffic in the desired way. For that reason, a car following model fulfilling the requirements above was developed. Inspired by [1], our car-following model is nondeterministic and data-driven. It is based on the data set of the Intelligent Cruise Control Field Operational Test [2], in which instrumented vehicles have been used by 108 voluntary drivers for several weeks yielding trajectories of approximately 88,000 driving kilometres. In our model, the acceleration a of a vehicle depends on the following input: -v, the velocity of the vehicle, -âv, the difference between the velocity of the preceding vehicle and its own velocity, -g, the gap between the vehicle and the preceding vehicle and -aL, the acceleration of the preceding vehicle. The acceleration a underlies a probability distribution that depends on v, âv, g and aL. That means, if v*, âv*, g* and aL* are the current values for v, âv, g and aL, then there exist a probability distribution F(v*,âv*,g*,aL*) and the actual acceleration a will be drawn from F(v*,âv*,g*,aL*). For each tuple (v,âv,g,aL), the probability distribution F(v,âv,g,aL) was determined by the data of the FOT. For that, the data of velocity, velocity difference, gap and acceleration of the preceding vehicle were binned, and for each tuple (v,âv,g,aL) of binned values, the expected acceleration, the variance and the type of distribution were computed and stored in look-up tables. During a simulation, the probability distribution F(v,âv,g,aL) to a given tuple (v,âv,g,aL) can be recovered by these look-up tables. To achieve probability distributions that result in a well behaving car-following model, the data had to be corrected (due to erroneous sensor data) and filtered (due to situations in which the driver reacted to other influences besides the preceding vehicle, e.g. red traffic lights) in numerous steps. Here, we will present the mentioned correction and filtering steps in detail. Further, we will discuss the derived probability distributions and the calibration of the model. Finally, the model will be evaluated and compared to other existing car-following models in several scenarios with respect to various criteria, e.g. the number of accidents, the distribution of surrogate safety measures, and the fundamental diagram."

abstract = "Various stochastic factors (e.g., the driverâs individual properties) widely exist in the real traffic system, but the existing studies cannot completely describe the impacts of various stochastic factors on traffic flow (especially the driving behavior). In this paper, we introduce the driverâs three perceived errors into the car-following model, and construct a car-following model with the probability distributions of the three perceived errors to explore the effects of the three perceived errors on the driving behavior under three typical situations (i.e., uniform flow, shock and rarefaction waves, and a small perturbation). The numerical results show that the three perceived errors have significant impacts on the evolution of traffic flow (including the headway distribution), i.e., the distribution of density does not prominently change under the three traffic states. In addition, the impacts are directly related to the initial condition. The results can help drivers reasonably adjust their driving behaviors based on their current traffic state (especially when some stochastic factors exist)."
